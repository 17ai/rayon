# Rayon

Rayon is a data-parallelism library for Rust. It is extremely
lightweight and makes it easy to convert a sequential computation into
a parallel one. It also guarantees data-race freedom.

*Warning:* This is a proof-of-concept and performance, in particular,
will be terrible right now. But it should be easily improved.
