# Release 0.3 (not yet released)

- Expanded `par_iter` APIs now available:
  - `into_par_iter` is now supported on vectors (taking ownership of the elements)
- Panic handling is much improved:
  - if you use the Nightly feature, experimental panic recovery is available
  - otherwise, panics propagate out and poision the workpool
- New `Configuration` object to control number of threads and other details
- New demos and benchmarks
  - try `cargo run --release -- visualize` in `demo/nbody` :)
    - Note: a nightly compiler is required for this demo due to the
      use of the `+=` syntax

Thanks to @bjz, @cuviper, @Amanieu, and @willi-kappler for their contributions!
