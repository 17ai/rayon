//! Benchmark Fibonacci numbers, F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
//!
//! Recursion is a horrible way to compute this -- roughly O(2ⁿ).
//! 
//! It's potentially interesting for rayon::join, because the splits are
//! unequal.  F(n-1) has roughly twice as much work to do as F(n-2).  The
//! imbalance might make it more likely to leave idle threads ready to steal
//! jobs.  We can also see if there's any effect to having the larger job first
//! or second.
//!
//! We're doing very little real work in each job, so the rayon overhead is
//! going to dominate.  The serial recursive version will likely be faster,
//! unless you have a whole lot of CPUs.  The iterative version reveals the
//! joke.
